Fish Tank Production ReadMe


Fish Tank is an interactive demo that allows the user to interact with simulated fish in a fish tank. Users can drag and drop the fish.

Each fish has a unique movement pattern that's randomly generated when the constructor function is called and subsequently changes as it interacts with the boundaries of the fishtank and user input.

Several fetures remain to be implemented, including music from the jukebox and feeding interaction.


Look forward to more updates soon.
